Manim is a Python library used for creating mathematical animations and
interactive graphics. Manim has a wide range of features, including
animation, text-to-speech, and graphing. In this scene, we will use some 
of
these features to create an animation that demonstrates how the 
plaintext
block is transformed into the ciphertext block through a series of
substitution and permutation operations.
The first step in creating this scene is to import the Manim library and
define the objects that we will be using. We will need two rectangles to
represent the plaintext and ciphertext blocks, as well as a key rectangle
to represent the encryption key. We can use the following code to define
these objects:

from manim import *

class CipherScene(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        # Define the plaintext block
        plaintext = Rectangle(width=1, height=2)
        plaintext.move_to(LEFT)

        # Define the ciphertext block
        ciphertext = Rectangle(width=1, height=2)
        ciphertext.move_to(RIGHT)

        # Define the key rectangle
        key = Rectangle(width=1, height=2)
        key.move_to(UP)

        # Add the objects to the scene
        self.add(plaintext, ciphertext, key)

In this code, we define three rectangles representing the plaintext,
ciphertext, and encryption key blocks. We move the plaintext block to the
left of the screen and the ciphertext block to the right, while keeping 
the
key rectangle in the center. We then add these objects to the scene 
using
the `add()` method.
Once we have defined our objects, we can start animating them. The first
step is to create a substitution cipher that replaces each letter with a
letter that is a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. We can use
Manim's text-to-speech features to explain this process as follows:

class CipherScene(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        ...
        # Add the substitution cipher explanation
        self.play(Write(Text("Substitution Cipher").scale(0.5)))
        self.wait(2)
        self.play(FadeOut(plaintext))
        self.wait(1)
        self.play(
            Write(Text("Each letter is replaced by a letter that is 3 
positions down the alphabet.").scale(0.5)),
            run_time=2,
        )
        self.wait(1)

In this code, we use the `Write()` function to create a text object that
explains the substitution cipher process. We then use the `play()` method
to add an animation that writes the text object on the screen and waits 
for
2 seconds before fading out the plaintext block. Finally, we use 
another
`play()` method to write another text object that explains how each letter
is replaced by a letter 3 positions down the alphabet, and wait for 1
second before continuing with the animation.
Next, we can create an animation that demonstrates how the letters are
substituted in the plaintext block using the substitution cipher. We can 
use
Manim's `animate()` method to create a custom animation that performs the
letter substitution operations:

class CipherScene(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        ...
        # Animate the letter substitution operations
        self.play(Animate(plaintext, "Substitution", 3))
        self.wait(2)

In this code, we use the `Animate()` method to create a custom animation
that performs the letter substitution operations in the plaintext block. 
We
pass in the `plaintext` object as the first argument, followed by the 
name
of the animation ("Substitution") and the number of positions down the
alphabet that each letter should be substituted (3). Finally, we use the
`wait()` method to pause the animation for 2 seconds before continuing 
with
the next step.
Once we have performed the substitution cipher operations on the plaintext
block, we can create an animation that demonstrates how the blocks are
mixed up and reshuffled using a simple permutation operation. We can use
Manim's `animate()` method again to create a custom animation for this:

class CipherScene(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        ...
        # Animate the permutation operations
        self.play(Animate(plaintext, "Permutation", 3))
        self.wait(2)

In this code, we use the `Animate()` method again to create a custom
animation that performs the permutation operations on the plaintext block.
We pass in the same arguments as before, but this time using the name of 
the
animation ("Permutation") and the number of positions down the alphabet
that each letter should be permuted (3). Finally, we use the `wait()` 
method
to pause the animation for 2 seconds before continuing with the next step.
Finally, we can create an animation that demonstrates how the plaintext
block is transformed into the ciphertext block through a series of
substitution and permutation operations. We can use Manim's `animate()`
method again to create a custom animation for this:

class CipherScene(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        ...
        # Animate the encryption process
        self.play(Animate(plaintext, "Substitution", 3))
        self.wait(2)
        self.play(Animate(plaintext, "Permutation", 3))
        self.wait(2)

In this code, we use the `Animate()` method again to create a custom
animation that performs the substitution and permutation operations on
the plaintext block. We pass in the same arguments as before, but this 
time
using the name of the animation ("Substitution" and "Permutation") 
and the
number of positions down the alphabet that each letter should be 
substituted
and permuted (3). Finally, we use the `wait()` method to pause the 
animation
for 2 seconds before continuing with the next step.
Overall, this scene demonstrates how the plaintext block is transformed 
into
the ciphertext block through a series of substitution and permutation
operations. The animation is created using Manim's text-to-speech and
animation features, which allow us to explain the process in more detail 
and
create a visually engaging demonstration of the encryption process.
