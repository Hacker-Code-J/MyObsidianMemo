### Compile Your Program with Debugging Information

This option tells the compiler to include debugging information in the executable, which GDB can use to debug the program.

```bash
gcc -g main.c -o main
```

### Step 2: Start GDB

You start GDB with your program as an argument.

```bash
gdb ./main
```

### Step 3: Set Breakpoints

```bash
(gdb) break main.c:10
```

### Step 4: Run Your Program

```bash
(gdb) run
```

### Step 5: Examine the State of Your Program 

```bash
(gdb) print variable_name
```

### Step 6: Step Through Your Program 

- To step to the next line in the current function:
```bash
(gdb) n
```

- To step into a function:
```bash
(gdb) s
```

### Step 7: Continue Execution

```bash
(gdb) continue
```

### Step 8: Quit GDB

Once you're done debugging, you can exit GDB.

```bash
(gdb) quit
```
### Additional Tips

- Use the `list` command in GDB to view the source code around the current line or a specified line.
- Use the `watch` command to set a watchpoint on a variable to stop execution whenever the variable changes.
- GDB offers many more features and commands; consult the GDB manual for more in-depth information.
