### Compile Your Program with Debugging Information

This option tells the compiler to include debugging information in the executable, which GDB can use to debug the program.

```bash
gcc -g main.c -o main
```

### Step 2: Start GDB

You start GDB with your program as an argument.

```bash
gdb ./main
```
