1. **Machine-Dependent Size**:
    - In a 32-bit architecture, `usize` is 32 bits (4 bytes) long, just like `size_t` would be on a 32-bit system in C.
    - In a 64-bit architecture, it's 64 bits (8 bytes) long, similar to `size_t` on a 64-bit system in C.
2. **Primary Use Cases**:
    - Like `size_t` in C, `usize` is primarily used for indexing and addressing. It's the type you would use for array or vector indices, sizes of collections, and for any value that represents a memory size or count.
    - The similarity in use between `usize` and `size_t` makes it a natural choice for tasks where you need an integer type that can comfortably represent the size of any object in memory.
3. **Why `usize` and Not a Fixed-Size Type**:
    - Rust, like C, is used in systems programming, which often requires dealing directly with memory. Using a machine-dependent type like `usize` allows Rust programs to be both efficient and safe on different architectures.
    - For instance, if you are iterating over a vector or an array, using `usize` for the index ensures that your index variable can always represent the maximum possible size of your collection, regardless of whether the program is running on a 32-bit or 64-bit machine.
4. **Safety Implications**:
    - Rust emphasizes memory safety. Using `usize` for memory sizes and indices aligns with this philosophy, as it reduces the chances of overflow errors and other memory-related bugs that can be common in C when using inappropriate integer types for memory sizes.

In summary, `usize` in Rust serves a similar purpose to `size_t` in C, being the go-to integer type for memory sizes, array indices, and similar uses, with its size automatically adapting to the architecture of the machine it's compiled for.
